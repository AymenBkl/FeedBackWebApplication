# FeedBackWebApplication
A small web  Application that built with  both angular as front-end framework and node-js that will control the server side  in order to allow the user to post his feedback and view other user feedback 


# AngularJs
  a javasacript modern framework that will faciliate your work from obvserving the data flows in your application,asynchronous application , built-in material (Angular Material) and the anotiation of modules that will combine between your template and the dom .
  
  ## ReactiveJs 
  
    In order to track all the data flow in your application it good point to use reactivejs, it will provide for a simple implementation of tracking your data , not only that but it will also garantie that your application will work in real time with reactivejs we can use HttpClient in order to communicate with our server in asynchrouse way , and it will handle the data for us when the server response without blocking or slowing up the application . If an error occurs you have the upper hand to decide how to deal with it .
    
  ## Animations 
  
     User experience in your website is important point to focus in , adding some animations will encourage the user to do someactions in your website, with angular animation becomes more easy we can implement them at any time or wherever we want .
     
  ## Directives 
  
      It cool to call some attributes in your element for example a class or style ext .. , with directives things become mush easier you can use those directives to define listners,styles and to mush more , the cool part about them is your can use them just like attributes .
      
  ## Form Validation 
  
      form validation is one of the important thing in web developement , but with angular form validation becomes mush easier with both way directive forms or reactive forms you can controll and see what the user is typing and that how you get what you need from the user . Also for security stuffs (this not our subject :) ) .
